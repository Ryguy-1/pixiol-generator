# 🌐✨ Pixiol Generator (2/2) - Creating AI News Content at Scale 🚀

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the Pixiol project! The project aims to showcase the power of integrating LLMs and (Text -> Image) Diffusion Models for mass content creation. 🤖🎨

### Technologies Used ⚙️

- **Docker / Docker Compose:** For containerization, ensuring that the app runs consistently across all environments. 🐳📦
- **Huggingface Diffusers:** For generating images from text, allowing us to create content dynamically and at scale. 🤖🎨
- **Huggingface Hub:** For miscellaneous models like the current NSFW classifier providing better content safety. 🤖🔍
- **Contentful:** As the headless CMS, providing a robust backend for content management that integrates seamlessly with our frontend. 📚🔗
- **LangChain:** For easy transfer between LLMs allowing better modularity and flexibility. 🤖🔗
- **Ollama**: For easily running LLMs locally, allowing us to generate content without having to rely on external services. 🤖🏠
- **OpenAI API:** Implemented, but not used due to cost (and Ollama + Mistral being free and similar in performance). 🤖💸

## Features 🌟

- **Integration of LLMs and Text-to-Image Diffusion Models:** This is the heart of Pixiol. The app aims to demonstrate how these AI models can be used to create and manage content dynamically and at scale. 🤖🎨
- **Containerization:** The app is containerized using Docker and Docker Compose, ensuring that it runs consistently across all environments. 🐳📦
- **Headless CMS:** The app uses Contentful as the headless CMS, providing a robust backend for content management that integrates seamlessly with our frontend. 📚🔗
- **Modularity:** The app is designed to be modular, allowing for easy transfer between LLMs and other models. 🤖🔗
- **Local LLMs:** The app uses Ollama to run LLMs locally, allowing us to generate content without having to rely on external services. 🤖🏠
- **NSFW Classifier:** The app uses a NSFW classifier to ensure that the generated content is safe for all audiences. 🤖🔍
