## Scrambled Eggs

Let's start with a breakfast classic – scrambled eggs. To make the fluffiest and most flavorful scrambled eggs, follow these steps:

1. Crack 2-3 eggs into a bowl and whisk them until the yolks and whites are fully combined.
2. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat and add a pat of butter or a drizzle of olive oil.
3. Pour the whisked eggs into the skillet and let them cook without stirring for a few seconds.
4. Use a spatula to gently fold and stir the eggs, creating soft curds.
5. Cook until the eggs are just set but still slightly creamy, about 2-3 minutes.
6. Season with salt, pepper, and any desired toppings like cheese, chives, or diced tomatoes.

### Sunny-Side-Up Eggs

Sunny-side-up eggs are a sunny and delicious way to start your day. Here's how to make them:

1. Heat a non-stick skillet over low heat and add a small amount of butter or oil.
2. Crack an egg into the skillet and cook it undisturbed until the whites are set and the yolk is still runny.
3. Cover the skillet with a lid to help the top of the egg cook faster.
4. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately for that perfect runny yolk experience.

## Poached Eggs

Poached eggs are a brunch favorite and add a touch of elegance to any dish. Here's how to poach an egg perfectly:

1. Fill a wide saucepan with about 2 inches of water and bring it to a gentle simmer.
2. Add a splash of white vinegar to the simmering water (it helps the egg whites coagulate).
3. Crack an egg into a small bowl.
4. Create a gentle whirlpool in the simmering water with a spoon and carefully slide the egg into the center.
5. Let the egg poach for 3-4 minutes for a runny yolk or 5-6 minutes for a firmer yolk.
6. Use a slotted spoon to carefully remove the poached egg from the water.

### Soft-Boiled Eggs

Soft-boiled eggs are a delightful treat, especially when served with toast soldiers. Here's how to make them:

1. Bring a pot of water to a boil and gently add the eggs.
2. Reduce the heat to a low simmer and cook for exactly 4-5 minutes for a runny yolk or 6-7 minutes for a slightly firmer yolk.
3. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the eggs to an ice water bath to stop the cooking process.
4. Once cool, tap the top of the egg with a spoon and peel away the shell.
5. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.
